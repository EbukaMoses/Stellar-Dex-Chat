## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

We use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to securely report security vulnerabilities.

**To report a security vulnerability:**

1. Visit the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/leojay-net/Stellar-Dex-Chat/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details of the vulnerability
4. Submit the report privately

This ensures that the report is only visible to the repository maintainers until a fix is released.

- A description of the vulnerability

### Response Targets

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours of receiving a report
- **Triaging**: Within 7 days of receiving a report
- **Fix timeline**: Depending on severity, typically within 30 days

### Security Best Practices

- Never include private keys or sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
